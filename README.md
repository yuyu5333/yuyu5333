🔭 I’m currently working on a multi-spectral mosaic image restoration project at the Xi'an Institute of Optics and Precision Mechanics of CAS, where I develop techniques to restore high-quality images by combining spatial and spectral information from multi-spectral images.

🎓 I am currently a Master's student at the School of Computer Science, Northwestern Polytechnical University, majoring in Computer Science and Technology with a focus on intelligent IoT terminals.

🌱 I'm pursuing my Master's degree in Computer Science and Technology at Northwestern Polytechnical University, specializing in image processing and machine learning.

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects that are focused on machine learning, data science, and IoT middleware platforms.

💬 Ask me about deep learning, Python programming, FPGA-based system design, or anything related to image and speech processing.
